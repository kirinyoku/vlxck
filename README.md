## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Git (for building from source)

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kirinyoku/vlxck.git
cd vlxck

# Build the binary
go build -o vlxck

# Move the binary to your PATH
sudo mv vlxck /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/kirinyoku/vlxck@latest
```

## Getting Started

### Initialize a New Store

When you run your first command, vlxck will automatically create a new encrypted store:

```bash
vlxck add -n example.com -v yourpassword
```

You'll be prompted to set a master password. This password will be required to access your secrets.

## Usage

### Add a New Secret

```bash
vlxck add -n example.com -v yourpassword -c websites
```

Options:
- `-n, --name`: Name/identifier for the secret (required)
- `-v, --value`: The secret value (required)
- `-c, --category`: Category for organization (optional)

### Retrieve a Secret

```bash
vlxck get -n example.com
```

### List All Secrets

```bash
# List all secrets
vlxck list

# Filter by category
vlxck list -c websites
```

### Generate a Strong Password

```bash
# Generate a 16-character password with symbols and numbers
vlxck generate -l 16 -s -n
```

Options:
- `-l, --length`: Length of the password (default: 12)
- `-s, --symbols`: Include special characters
- `-n, --numbers`: Include digits

### Delete a Secret

```bash
vlxck delete -n example.com
```

### Change Master Password

```bash
vlxck change-master
```

## Security

- All data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Master password is never stored
- Uses Argon2id for key derivation
- Encrypted data is stored in `~/.vlxck/store.dat`
