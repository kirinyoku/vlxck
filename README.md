## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Git (for building from source)

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kirinyoku/vlxck.git
cd vlxck

# Build the binary
go build -o vlxck

# Move the binary to your PATH
sudo mv vlxck /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/kirinyoku/vlxck@latest
```

## Getting Started

### Initialize a New Store

When you run your first command, vlxck will automatically create a new encrypted store:

```bash
vlxck add -n example.com -V yourpassword
```

You'll be prompted to set a master password. This password will be required to access your secrets.

## Usage

### Add a New Secret

```bash
# Add a secret with a specific value
vlxck add -n example.com -V yourpassword -c websites

# Generate a random password with default settings (16 chars, letters only)
vlxck add -n example.com -g -c websites

# Generate a custom password (24 chars with symbols and digits)
vlxck add -n example.com -gdsl 24 -c websites

# Interactive mode (guided prompts)
vlxck add -i
```

Options:
- `-n, --name`: Name/identifier for the secret (required in non-interactive mode)
- `-V, --value`: The secret value (either this or --generate is required in non-interactive mode)
- `-g, --generate`: Generate a random password (overrides -V if both specified)
- `-l, --length`: Length of the generated password (default: 16)
- `-s, --symbols`: Include special characters in generated password
- `-d, --digits`: Include digits in generated password
- `-c, --category`: Category for organization (optional)
- `-i, --interactive`: Use interactive mode (overrides other flags)

Password Generation Examples:
- `-g`: 16-character letters-only password
- `-gsd`: 16-character password with symbols and digits
- `-gdsl 24`: 24-character password with digits and symbols
- `-gsl 20`: 20-character password with symbols (no digits)

### Update an Existing Secret

```bash
# Update a secret with a new value
vlxck update -n example.com -V newpassword

# Update just the category
vlxck update -n example.com -c social-media

# Generate a new random password for the secret
vlxck update -n example.com -g

# Update both value and category
vlxck update -n example.com -V newpassword -c work

# Interactive mode (guided prompts)
vlxck update -i
```

Options:
- `-n, --name`: Name/identifier of the secret to update (required in non-interactive mode)
- `-V, --value`: New secret value (either this or --generate is required in non-interactive mode)
- `-g, --generate`: Generate a new random password for the secret
- `-l, --length`: Length of the generated password (default: 16)
- `-s, --symbols`: Include special characters in generated password
- `-d, --digits`: Include digits in generated password
- `-c, --category`: Update the category (optional)
- `-i, --interactive`: Use interactive mode (overrides other flags)

### Retrieve a Secret

Retrieve a secret and automatically copy it to your clipboard:

```bash
# Interactive mode - select from a list of secrets
vlxck get -i

# Non-interactive mode - specify the secret name
vlxck get -n example.com
```

Options:
- `-n, --name`: Name/identifier of the secret to retrieve (required in non-interactive mode)
- `-i, --interactive`: Use interactive mode to select from a list of secrets

The secret value will be copied to your clipboard automatically. This helps prevent accidentally displaying sensitive information in your terminal history or on screen.

### List All Secrets

```bash
# List all secrets
vlxck list

# Filter by category
vlxck list -c websites
```

### Generate a Strong Password

```bash
# Generate a 24-character password with symbols and digits
vlxck generate -sdl 24
```

Options:
- `-l, --length`: Length of the password (default: 16)
- `-s, --symbols`: Include special characters
- `-d, --digits`: Include digits

### Delete a Secret

Delete a secret from the store by its name or through interactive selection:

```bash
# Interactive mode - select secret to delete from a list
vlxck delete -i

# Non-interactive mode - specify the secret name
vlxck delete -n example.com
```

Options:
- `-n, --name`: Name of the secret to delete (required in non-interactive mode)
- `-i, --interactive`: Use interactive mode to select from a list of secrets

Interactive Mode:
When using interactive mode (`-i`), you'll be guided through the deletion process:
1. Select which secret to delete from a list
2. Confirm the deletion to prevent accidental data loss
3. The secret will be permanently removed if confirmed

### Change Master Password

```bash
vlxck change-master
```

### Export Your Secrets

Export your encrypted secrets to a backup location:

```bash
# Export to a specific directory
vlxck export -d /path/to/backup/directory
```

This will create a `store.dat` file in the specified directory containing your encrypted secrets.

Options:
- `-d, --dir`: Directory to export the store file to (required)

### Import Secrets

Import secrets from an encrypted backup file. You can choose to either replace your current store or merge with existing secrets:

```bash
# Basic import (replaces current store)
vlxck import -f /path/to/backup/store.dat

# Use the current store's password for import
vlxck import -f /path/to/backup/store.dat -p

# Merge with existing secrets (interactive conflict resolution)
vlxck import -f /path/to/backup/store.dat -m

# Merge using the current store's password
vlxck import -f /path/to/backup/store.dat -m -p
```

#### Merge Behavior
When using the merge option (`-m`), the import process will:
1. Keep all unique secrets from both the current store and import file
2. For secrets that exist in both:
   - Show a comparison of both versions
   - Prompt you to choose an action:
     - `[l]` Keep local version
     - `[i]` Use imported version
     - `[s]` Skip this secret (neither version will be included)

Options:
- `-f, --file`: Path to the import file (required)
- `-p, --use-store-password`: Use the current store's master password for import
- `-m, --merge`: Merge secrets from import file into existing store (interactive)

**Warning:** Without the `-m` flag, this will replace your current store with the imported one. Make sure you have a backup if needed.

## Backup and Restore

vlxck provides robust backup and restore functionality to keep your data safe.

### Create a Backup

Create a compressed backup of your entire password store:

```bash
# Create a backup in the default location (~/.vlxck/backups/)
vlxck backup

# Create a backup in a specific directory
vlxck backup /path/to/backup/directory
```

Backups are stored as timestamped zip archives (e.g., `backup_20250620-183238.zip`).

### List Available Backups

View all available backups with their sizes and creation times:

```bash
# List backups in the default location
vlxck list-backups

# List backups in a specific directory
vlxck list-backups /path/to/backup/directory
```

### Restore from Backup

Restore your password store from a previous backup:

```bash
# Interactive mode - choose from a list of available backups
vlxck restore -i

# Restore a specific backup file
vlxck restore /path/to/backup/backup_20250620-183238.zip

# Restore to a specific directory
vlxck restore -i /custom/restore/path
```

Options:
- `-i, --interactive`: Show an interactive menu to select from available backups
- `[backup-file]`: Path to a specific backup file to restore from
- `[target-dir]`: (Optional) Directory to restore the backup to (default: ~/.vlxck)

## Security

- All data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Uses Argon2id for key derivation
- Encrypted data is stored in `~/.vlxck/store.dat`

### Password Caching

vlxck caches your master password in memory for 5 minutes after successful verification to improve usability. This means you won't need to re-enter your password for subsequent commands within this time window.

- The password is stored securely in an encrypted cache file
- The cache is automatically cleared after 5 minutes
- You can clear the cache immediately by pressing Ctrl+C or waiting for the timeout
- The cache is never written to disk in plaintext

For maximum security, the cache is also cleared when:
- You change your master password
- The program is interrupted
- The system is shut down or restarted
